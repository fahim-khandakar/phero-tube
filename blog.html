            <span class="text-xl font-bold">Q:</span> Discuss the scope of var,
            let, and const
          </h1>
          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Ans: </span
            ><span class="font-medium">var: </span>The scope of a var variable
            is functional scope or global scope, depending on where they are
            declared. <br />
            <span class="font-medium">let: </span>The scope of a let variable is
            block scope. This means that they are accessible only within the
            block in which they are defined, such as a loop, conditional
            statement, or a function. <br />
            <span class="font-medium">const: </span>Variables declared with
            const also have block scope similar to let, but they come with an
            additional constraint: they are used to declare constants, which
            means their value cannot be reassigned after the initial assignment.

          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Ans: </span
            ><span class="font-medium">undefined: </span>Undefined means the
            variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.
            <br />
            <span class="font-medium">null: </span>Intentional Absence of Value:
            null is often used to represent the intentional absence of any
            object value or the absence of a value that should exist. It is
            typically assigned to a variable to indicate that the variable is
            intentionally empty or has no value.

            <span class="text-xl font-bold">Q:</span> What do you mean by REST
            API?
          </h1>
          <p>
            <span class="text-lg font-medium">Ans:</span> An API, or application
            programming interface, is a set of rules that define how
            applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each
            other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles
            of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.
